Linux configs for i3, urxvt, ranger, etc...

I am setting up i3 on my Solus machine and am using the AMAZING Manjaro config as a reference as I prepare to build out my very own config.  I've also added a copy of the default config for i3 in case I mess anything up along the way.  In the future I'll be adding configs for other utilities such as i3lock, urxvt, ranger, vim, etc...
